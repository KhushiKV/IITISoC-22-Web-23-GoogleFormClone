# IITI-SoC-2022-Google Form Clone 

## Summary: 
We were assigned to work on a project in which we created a responsive web application that allows users to create and fill out forms. The project was mainly divided into two parts –front-end development and backend development. While working on the project we need to perform tasks like front-end coding, back-end coding, designing the web page, and adding content.
In the first part of the project which is creating the front end part, we used React JS Library for building user interfaces based on user interface components (UI), which provided faster and better ways to create customized components including inputs, selects,buttons and potentially new components, HTML to create the basic structuring of the web application, CSS for the presentation and designing of it, and JavaScript for the functioning and interactivity of the website.
In the second part which was developing the back end of the application, we also used Node JS which helped us to generate dynamic page content, and can create, write, open, read, delete and close files on the server. Used  Express which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Also used Redux which allowed us to manage our app’s state in a single place and kept changes in app more predictable and traceable.  


## Tech Stacks Used: 
1.	JavaScript
2.	ReactJS
3.	NodeJS
4.	Express 
5.	Redux  

## Salient Features: 

### Following are the salient features we tried to include in our web application - 

•	Users can create and fill forms having different types of widgets.

•	The web application allows users to see all previous forms created in the past and their responses in a separate sheet.

•	Users can create other widgets/inputs such as checkboxes, multiple-choice up to 5 options, short text, short paragraphs, etc. 

•	Single correct or multiple correct answers to a question can be added by the user according to the requirement. 

•	Users can add, delete or copy and paste questions in the web application.  

•	Users can use pre-prepared templates of forms.

•	We also added the feature which allows users to drag and drop the questions while creating the new form. 

•	Users can add Answer key to their form and also can allot points to each question.

•	Users can also upload files.

•	While preparing  the Question form of their own, they can preview and take a look of how their form will look like.

•	Answers submitted by the users are saved in the Excel sheet which will update after each new form submission.
